# Overview

After messing around in Unreal Engine 5 I quickly realized that I am not an entire studio, I'm just one college student, so I used 99% of the default assets provided by Unreal Engine 5 and tried my very best to understand what was going on. There's a little green play button at the top of the editor that plays the game, and you use WSAD and space to control the car, and mouse to control the camera.

I used Unreal Engine 5 because it is brand new and the demos blew me away, so I wanted to see how hard it was to jump in and make something.
